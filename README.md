An Android Application built to bridge the gap between academia and industry. The application implements Natural Language Processing and Data Science. Fresh graduates and unemployed individuals can join the application to build teams for their personal projects and recruit. After working on projects they can apply for jobs through the application. Job recommendation is implemented through an AI based recommendation engine using NLP and Cosine Similarity. The user's skillset is converted into a feature vector using an NLP technique 'Count Vectorizer'. This feature vector is compared to the skillsets of all the jobs in the dataset. The top 20 jobs which have the most similar skillset of that of the user are generated through Cosine Similarity. Team recommendation is generated using Firebase Database. Final Year Project for Bachelors.

Unfortunately, I was facing errors in uploading Android Files onto Github. I have uploaded a google drive link which contains all of the project data. Android files, Android apk, python files and python notebook file in which recommendation engine is implemented, demo videos of the project, recommendation engine output pictures, project report, dataset, project presentation , and software requirement specifications document.

This repository comprises of the dataset, the python notebook file in which the recommendation engine is implemented, and the Software document.
